# Open Letter to State Legistlature: SPS is Vastly Underfunded By The State
</div>

<div className={styles.card}>
On September 18, 2022, after the teacher strike, an number of parents collaborated on funding analysis resulting in an <a href="https://bit.ly/3E5yRXe">Open Letter showing Washington State is vastfully underfunding all of their schools</a> when compared to other states with
similar cost of living. This letter was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/awongawong/posts/pfbid0EqHMSPktfh8AbHuwLCFz8dJ7UrRw9gFbDipgkSGRr3T6qsg5ECcf8vwqsuXeeVZel">was shared on Facebook</a> and posted on multiple private forums. It made the case that Seattle Public Schools, in particular, is so adversely affected by state legistlation that teacher strikes and service degredation are almost guaranteed.

The letter was emailed on Sept 30th, with a short preamble, to all state senators, representatives, and candidates running for office in districts that intersect Seattle Public Schools.

<b>Subject:</b> A plan to fund Seattle Public Schools and special education RE: Seattleites demand fixes to state funding laws undermining SPS
</div>

To all parents and educators concerned about, and co-signing, letter on Seattle Public Schools’ budget limitations and inability to fund educators’ compensation, special education, etc. <a href="https://bit.ly/3E5yRXe">https://bit.ly/3E5yRXe</a> (please share):

Washington State – and we as your legislators – have not met our “Paramount Duty” to fully fund ‘basic education.” As the letter to legislators points out, the costs to live in Seattle as an educator far exceed what the State bases its funding formula on – and, “nothing is more basic to education than our educators.”

The biggest hits to Seattle Public Schools’ (SPS’) budget and ability to serve students and pay living wages is the State’s cap on the number of students with disabilities that the State will provide Special Education funding for. This cap is unconscionable, and I believe, unconstitutional. The cap leaves SPS with over $100 million deficit this year!

That means $100 million in levy funds, which would otherwise fund compensation, additional learning services and opportunities must be devoted to providing the services required by federal and state laws to students with disabilities. The lack of funding, as every parent of a child who has had to fight to get a child an IEP knows, leads to a pervasive resistance to providing the services needed for children to be healthy and learn. Parents may spend years trying to have students evaluated for disabilities and having services provided – while their child falls irreversibly farther and farther behind.

I have championed efforts to remove this cap since I became a legislator. We have encountered great resistance – winning only a small increase to serve 13.5% of students.

Closely related is the State’s funding formula providing funds for basically one paraeducator / instructional aide per grade in an elementary school of 450 students, even though students’ learning needs and IEPs may require several IAs per grade. Again, the District’s levy must pay for these staff – whose salaries are truly at an unconscionably low level.

In 2022, we finally passed an 8 fold increase in State funding for school nurses and social workers, which I helped champion, increasing from the State paying for just .07 of a nurse per elementary school to paying for each school to have more than a half time nurse.

In January, I will be offering legislation to remove the unconscionable cap on the number of students for which the State provides special education funds coupled with a major overhaul of evaluations to have meaningful timelines and the State paying for the evaluations.

If successful, Seattle would expect to receive an additional $100 million in funding for the 2023-24 school year and thousands of students would receive the services and supports they need to learn and be healthy.

What will it take to succeed? Please ask to have parent-educator meetings with your legislators (and every candidate) and ask if them to commit to supporting lifting the cap on State funding for students with disabilities. Coordinate with your PTSA, SEA and other organizations and share out the results of those meetings with legislators.

For residents of the 46th, I’m available to meet and to also join you to discuss SPS and education funding and other issues at your PTSA meetings.

Rep. Gerry Pollet,

46th District
