# Notes from Conv w/ Director Hampson on 2022 Strike
</div>

<div className={styles.card}>
Somewhere late on Sept 8, 2022, 2 days into the 2022 Teacher Strike, a user made an anonymous post on `/r/Seattle` politics claiming to have detatils notes from an hour long phone conversation Director Hampson allegedly made in
response to being emailed.

It is noteworthy because one of the largest cited gaps was the changes to the bargaining agreement
proposed by SPS to how Special Education staffing should be handled. Yet, until this point, 
there had been previously almost no information from SPS Administraton or SPS board
explaining why they this was such a large sticking point.

It remained up for some time and gained a number of comments, but by midday Sept 9, 2022 it was taken down. This
leave a large information gap for people who happened to have the digital fluency and time to read it.

Below is a copy of the reddit page in mhtml format (don't use Safari to read) from the morning of Sept 9th. It has been editted slightly to remove ads and some account info but the text and content is unchanged.
