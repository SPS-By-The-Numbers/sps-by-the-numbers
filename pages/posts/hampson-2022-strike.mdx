# Notes from Conv w/ Director Hampson on 2022 Strike
</div>

<div className={styles.card}>
Somewhere late on Sept 8, 2022, 2 days into the 2022 Teacher Strike, a user made an anonymous post on `/r/Seattle` politics claiming to have detatils notes from an hour long phone conversation Director Hampson allegedly made in
response to being emailed.

It is noteworthy because one of the largest cited gaps was the changes to the bargaining agreement
proposed by SPS to how Special Education staffing should be handled. Yet, until this point, 
there had been previously almost no information from SPS Administraton or SPS board
explaining why they this was such a large sticking point.

It remained up for some time and gained a number of comments, but by midday Sept 9, 2022 it was taken down. This
gives a large information advantage for people who happened to be online to read it.

This seems a little unfair so here is a copy of the reddit page from the morning of Sept 9th. It has been editted slightly to delete ads and some account info but the text and content is unchanged. Note the original reddit link still has the comment threads.
