# About SPS By The Numbers

This site was originally created in response to SPS's attempt to change the
bell-times because of a supposed inability to staff bus routes. A number
of parents threw together a survey and gathered over a thousand responses
showing an overwhelming preference to keep the existing bell-time structure,
even amongst families who still did not have service.

The survey data needed a place to be displayed and thus sps-by-the-numbers.com
was born.

In addition to that survey, some other tools and data analyses for SPS were
collated. The hope is this site will grow to be a respository for data-centric
information on SPS.

The site itself is fully opensource [on github](https://github.com/awong-dev/sps-by-the-numbers).
