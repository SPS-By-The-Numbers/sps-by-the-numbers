Then, the Seattle City Council last fall unanimously adopted Resolution 31856, which set a deadline of March 31 to complete the transfer of the properties, which include the Central Area Senior Center and Byrd Barr Place. The Durkan Administration has now missed the deadline set by the resolution.", "publish_date": "2019-04-23T00:00:00"}
