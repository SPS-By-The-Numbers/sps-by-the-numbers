Lewis (District 7 - Pioneer Square to Magnolia) announced his intentions to protect Pike Place Market from proposed legislation that would permanently strip historic districts of key administrative review authority. The Market, placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, was stripped of its independent administrative review processes like many other historic districts at the start of the COVID pandemic. This disconnect between the community stewards and administration of the Market has outlasted its need and is cutting out some of the Market\u2019s strongest advocates from discussions on its future. Thursday\u2019s event features representatives from Friends of the Market who have an extensive history of service to the Market and can speak to the importance of returning administrative review to the Market, provided by Councilmember Lewis\u2019 amendment to CB120456.\n\nSpeakers and attendees include:\nCouncilmember Andrew J. Lewis, Seattle City Council\nSara Patton, Friends of the Market advocate\nDuncan Thieme, Friends of the Market Board member\n\nView the City of Seattle's commenting policy: seattle.gov/online-comment-policy", "publish_date": "2023-01-26T00:00:00"}
