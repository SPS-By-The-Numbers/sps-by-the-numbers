Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez (Position 9, Citywide), Chair of the Gender Equity, Safe Communities, New Americans & Education Committee, stands with her Council colleagues and leaders of community organizations to outline a strategy for how the City can move forward and come into full and effective compliance with the federal consent decree.\n\n\nIn May, U.S. District Judge James Robart found the City of Seattle partially out of compliance with the federal consent decree, saying the City's ratified contract with the Seattle Police Officers' Guild (SPOG) fails to sufficiently address officer accountability in several key areas, including labor arbitration process, timeline for completing investigations and subpoena powers of civilian investigators. \n\n\nCouncilmembers Gonz\u00e1lez, Mosqueda and Herbold delivered a detailed letter to Mayor Durkan that expresses their preferred strategy to 1) center community-voices in ongoing police reform efforts, 2) maintain labor harmony and 3) return to full and effective compliance with the Consent Decree.", "publish_date": "2019-07-15T00:00:00"}
