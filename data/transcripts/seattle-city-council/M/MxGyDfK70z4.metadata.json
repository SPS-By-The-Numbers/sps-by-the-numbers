She came from a family dedicated to public service, including her mother Ruby Chow, who was the first Asian American elected to the King County Council. From early on in her career, Cheryl worked tirelessly for Seattleites, first as a teacher, then as a principal, and as a basketball and Chinese drill team coach. She went on to be elected to the Seattle City Council, serving on the governing body from 1990-1997. Later in her life, she came out as lesbian, and advocate for the LGBTQ community. This tribute video was made for Cheryl in 2012. She passed away the following year from central nervous system lymphoma.\n\nView the City of Seattle's commenting policy: seattle.gov/online-comment-policy", "publish_date": "2021-03-11T00:00:00"}
