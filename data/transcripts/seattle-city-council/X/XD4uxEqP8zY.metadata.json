Following cities such as Berkeley and more recently San Luis Obispo, O'Brien's proposal would support new construction to be 100% electric, which would eliminate carbon emissions from new buildings, as natural gas use in buildings is one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions in Seattle. \nSpeakers include:\nCouncilmember Mike O'Brien, City of Seattle\nJill Mangaliman, Executive Director, Got Green\nJess Wallach, Organizer, 350 Seattle\nMax Savishinsky, Executive Director, Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility\nAaron Fairchild, CEO, Green Canopy Homes\nChris Maykut, Founder, Chaco Canyon", "publish_date": "2019-09-05T00:00:00"}
