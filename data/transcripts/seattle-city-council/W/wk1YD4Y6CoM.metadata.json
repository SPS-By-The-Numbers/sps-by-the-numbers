Using zip code-level information gathered for the state-level capital gains excise tax, a local 2% could generate approximately $50 million annually, which would offset the amount City Halls General Fund takes from your water bills each year, so that this tax reform is essentially revenue-neutral. \n\nThe Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) consistently ranks Washington State as one of the most unfair systems in the country, where lower-income residents pay a much higher percentage of their household earnings for taxes and fees than wealthier residents.\n\nSpeakers include:\nCouncilmember Alex Pedersen, City of Seattle\n\nMore information: https://council.seattle.gov/2023/06/07/release-councilmember-pedersen-launches-bold-tax-reform-to-make-the-system-more-fair-for-seattle/\n\nView the City of Seattle's commenting policy: seattle.gov/online-comment-policy", "publish_date": "2023-06-07T00:00:00"}
