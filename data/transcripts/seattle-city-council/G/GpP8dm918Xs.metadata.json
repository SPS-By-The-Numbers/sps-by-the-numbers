Her ruling affirms that the FEIS meets all applicable requirements and allows the Seattle City Council to act on the proposal.\n\n\"I am thrilled that the Deputy Hearing Examiner agrees that the city's FEIS is adequate.  It means the Council can act early this summer to refine policies and provide a path for more people to build backyard cottages,\" said O'Brien.", "publish_date": "2019-05-14T00:00:00"}
