If outsourced company cannot meet the district’s need, it’s their responsibility to fix it, and it should not affect thousands of students and families. Think alternative solution; ask companies like Uber to help out, seek out can ban drivers. Or get the actual numbers of students who really need those transportations to school, not the “eligible” student counts. Ask every school if they really need these services. Ask families if they really need a bus in their routes. How many families actually would use bus in the morning if it comes at 6am, or 6:30am to pick up kids?? Don’t force families to change our life styles, SPS must try much much harder to focus on students’ health and wellness, not to focus on only business running point of view.",

Even with waivers, attendance limits mean many families cannot get into a school of choice based on the start time. This would negatively impact SPS in the long run and introduces broader social inequity by creating a divide between families able to afford private school and those that cannot. School start times should ideally not be a factor of consideration for school choice. This especially disadvantages smaller option schools from attracting students.",

Without the bus, it would have been impossible. Please keep working parents in mind when you are making these decisions. Younger kids who need help getting ready for school should have earlier start times, so parents can get to work -- whether or not they are commuting these days. And research supports that anyway. High schoolers who are getting themselves to school need later start times. Don't believe me? Stand outside a high school after bell time and watch a large percentage of kids slowly dribble in over the next half-hour. Finally...most high schoolers don't even get a bus, so I don't understand why they are part of the equation and need to have their time earlier. I saw Ashley Davies' comment that high schoolers are needed to do child care for younger kids, but...none of these scenarios actually support that. In every scenario a high schoolers get out later than elementary school kids. And anyway...surely there's another solution to the problem of working families needing after-school care.",

We use the bus service because it is the only way we can get to work on time with the 9am school start time; a later start time (9:30am, as planned for Decatur) would further exacerbate this issue.  The earlier tier start time (7:30am) would actually work fine for our family and we would NOT need bus service if that was when school started for our youngest.  We drop off our other son at school ourselves because the drop-off time allowed is before 8am.",
    "freeForm3TierImpact": "There is no pre-school care available at our son's school and both parents in our family work with start times before 8:15-8:30am on most days; these times are not flexible (teaching courses and rounding on patients).  We are already struggling with the 8am bus time to get to Decatur and when the bus is late one of use sometimes has to take our child to work, thus making him miss the early portion of the school day.  Our childcare program is concerned that if the Decatur time shifts they may ALSO not be able to offer care after school ends (due to the limited hours and difficulty recruiting staff), which would further worsen our childcare issues.",
    "freeFormOtherComments": "In addition, the schedule of young children favors learning earlier in the day rather than later and I think shifting times even later for elementary school students is not great for learning.",

Furthermore, the 4pm end time for us will be a disaster if extracurricular activities (swim team, tennis, soccer, music, religious school) don't flex. Already in NE Seattle there is a combination of end times, so there's no way for the local activities to fully adapt to accommodate everyone. For spring outdoor sports, this might not be a huge issue. But for fall sports and those with already limited slots (swimming) it may be impossible for my kids to participate in the activities they love because they will still be in school? The 2:25 end time allowed them to come home, do homework and eat before their activities. Now we will be skipping dinner and doing homework in the morning. Our work schedules will also have to shift. My work schedule (RN) has been based around Laurelhurst's 7:55am start time. If I wanted to change it to accommodate a 9:30 start, it would impact other people's schedules on my small team, and I don't know that I can ask that of them on a small team (who also bent over backward to help me out when the kids were out of school all of those months).",

This does not make any sense, and I believe SPS participated in some research showing that earlier start times were better for the younger kids, while the older kids (who can also stay home alone) benefit from the later morning start. I am in full support of equity in transportation. I just don't think we should all be forced to completely change our lives around and the lives of our children because the District cannot find a way to think outside the box on bus transportation. I have seen some great ideas posted on social media--they need to take these into consideration prior to up-ending the lives of families who have already endured schedule change after schedule change during the pandemic. Many of us have already cut hours and changed jobs to be home with our kids, we are now all finally returning to our jobs in 2019 capacity and digging into work. We are exhausted and worn out from all of the District's decisions that we feel we have no say in. This is all in light of a surge in COVID where we are again losing time at work to care for our kids and ourselves due to infections (which could have been minimized if the District asked kids to remain masked through the end of the school year). Enough is enough. Do better SPS.",

I am currently looking for a job and having to consider a 9:30 start time is incredibly harmful.

Also, families may need the bus in the morning and not the afternoon. Opt-in should be separate for each. Additionally, current bell schedules are matched with many studies about academic achievement. This proposal throws all that out of the window. I understand needing kids in school on time, but if they then have negative academic outcomes using this approach, what have you really gained?",

If our school start time changes I will only have between 10 and 12 each day to work, which reduces my work time from 20 hours to 10 hours and means either I can’t work this job or I need to figure out care for my children so I can work.  I don’t know if before care will be available for my sps student and if I have to pay for it then I don’t know if keeping my job is worth it.  Also, my daughter will be in 3rd grade.  She is exhausted in the afternoons, even on non school days, so I don’t see how she’s going to be expected to be in school working until 4.  She will get home late and family time will be reduced.  After school activities will also be impacted.  We are the only k-5 school in West Seattle with the 9:30 start.  Currently many after school activities we’ve participated in start at 3:30.

I would hope that your communication materials focus on these aspects more acutely in the future. I think it could do some good. Additionally many of our schools have a problem with no access to afterschool care on site. With a potential 2 PM dismissal next year, many of our working families will be scrambling again to find an afterschool care option for their kids. I hope that there are more efforts to partner with community-based organizations and set a goal of having a childcare option at every elementary site. Thank you. I know this is a very difficult situation to manage. I applaud your efforts to serve families in the best ways.  Don’t lose sight of the very bold effort you made a few years ago to have our adolescent students start their school day later. This has been an incredible step forward and making sure that our schools serve students’ needs first.",

This would disrupt and diminish his ability to get adequate sleep.  It would also be very difficult for other children In his school who bus from a greater distance.  Finally, my plan with the current bell times was for his older sibling (in middle school) to arrive home at approximately the same time and watch him after school.  With a 7:30 start time, the older sibling would arrive home an hour later, making this impossible.  Instead I will need to find and pay for some time of aftercare which I anticipate will be both logistically difficult and quite expensive.  I see this change as the district shifting their difficulty and financial challenges around hiring bus drivers onto families.  Problem solved for the district, but now thousands of families will be burdened with significant difficulty and expense.  Can’t we just raise the salaries for bus drivers?  That seems like a much better and simpler solution.",

If we opt for before care, this means an additional huge expense per month that we were not expecting and that would not have been necessary on the school's previous schedule.\n\nI am also concerned about my son's learning and social activities on this new schedule. He will be in kindergarten, and 4pm in the day feels very late to still be 'on' for school. Also, this makes after school activities difficult and cuts into family time.",

I feel like high school students' needs for sleep and sports have been prioritized, and while I'm glad that they are being considered, I am extremely disappointed at how elementary families have been left to pick up the dregs. These bell times put an extreme burden on working families that have children too young to take care of themselves before and after school.

We switched to a route with a driver (691). Then we lost our driver and neither route has returned. We lost our connection to after school childcare. The district claimed to care about transportation dependent families and child Care, but they put both routes in the last tier. I do not think 3 tiers is needed. I do not think we need as many bus routes, as I routinely get told by people they are “opting out” of the bus while we are desperately asking the district to restore a route. \nI would ask that the district prioritize Routes providing access to childcare and to allow people to opt out so they can not run more bus routes than necessary.",

    "freeFormOtherComments": "The district should be more strategic about transportation. If they don’t have enough drivers, then perhaps look at restoring one route per quadrant, so that certain neighborhoods are not left out until the end. I also have asked that the district consider distance travelled, since it creates a significant burden on families to travel farther 10x per week and has added up to lost wages and higher transportation costs. However, it appears to actually work against those families, as the district restored the closest routes first (which anecdotally have a higher % of families opting out because the transportation burden is minimal to get kids to/from school). Please prioritize routes that travel the farthest.",

We are being told that the on-site child care provider at our child's school is not likely to be able to staff only 1.5 hours of AM childcare and only 2 hours of after-school childcare. It is just as difficult and much more expensive to secure in-home childcare for the same spread-out timeframe. Especially if AM childcare is not provided, this would result in limited work hours for one of the parents in our home, including preventing the ability to work full-time/reduced earnings potential, and disruption to the other parent. This has a trickle-down effect to the community, where those of us who work in healthcare clinics with set hours are therefore not available to serve our patients.",
    "freeFormOtherComments": "SPS should consider an \"opt in\" plan to confirm the number of people who actually need to use the bus to get to school, AND who would actually be able to make these proposed times work, as there are likely many families out there who would use other options. I have heard from several SPS families who use the bus that they would drive their kids to a childcare provider prior to school with the 9:30am start time, or drive their child due to the inability of children to wake at 5:45am to catch a 6:15 bus (true story for one parent) which is what would happen with the 7:30am start time. SPS should also consider working with a route optimization company to use the existing buses to collect the children who truly need bus service and distribute them to schools. There are companies whose sole job is to optimize delivery routes who could help solve this problem, and also help maximize bus capacity.",

To be honest, the 7:50am start time is already too early for my kids - even though they are asleep and in bed by (or before) 8pm every night, they still struggle with waking up early enough to get to school by 7:50am.\n\nAdditionally, shifting pickup even earlier (to 2pm, and 12:50pm on Wednesdays) would be terrible for both me and my husband, who both work full time jobs. I don't know how our aftercare program would accommodate this change and there is a chance they may not be able to, which would really put us in a bind.\n\nOn the flip side, I know plenty of parents who have the 9:30am start time who are struggling with what to do for before care since getting to work at 10am is also not feasible for most parents.",
    "freeFormOtherComments": "There has to be a better way to accommodate bus schedules other than creating a 3 tiered start time system. Some other ideas:\n1) I'm sure some schools use bussing a lot more than others. Could you find out which schools have the most # of kids riding the bus (via a survey sent to all families), and group those schools together in a few common bus routes, and redistribute bus resources away from schools who don't use bussing as much, thereby allowing us to keep the current start/end times?\n2) Similar plan as above - gather data on who is using bussing and which schools they go to, but if it's necessary to do a 3 tiered split, reduce the spread and redistribute resources towards more schools that need bussing (e.g. schools that need a lot of bussing start at 750am or 900am, schools that don't start at 830am). \n3) Allow each school to determine the optimal start time for their families based on bussing usage (e.g. schools that don't need a lot of bussing can stay at their current start times)\n4) Keep the current start times, but increase pay and benefits for bus drivers so it's easier to hire enough drivers to keep things as is.\n\nI'm sure there are many more creative options that can be explored vs. just switching to a hard 3 tiered start time system! Please please urge the district to reconsider this change, on behalf of all parents who have kids at SPS!! Appreciate your help and work on this!",

It would mean having to find parking, and walk possibly several blocks to get my 1st grader to school with my 4yo in tow if he's awake.

My 6yo already goes to bed 7-7:30 and has therapy activities that sometimes go until 6 or 6:30 so I would need to revaluate whether we could continue with them. I would hope for after school activities to be reintroduced next year and do those instead.",

It is ok but not ideal for my family to start our kids school at 930am because I work part time to care for my kids unlike some lower income or single parent households. Some parents really need to work a full time jobs sometime more than 2 jobs to support families. For young students who are elementary school ages, they really need adults for safety reasons. That's why younger kids go to after school school programs. Middle and high school kids can take care of themselves. Nowadays, we are suffering from labor shortage across all industries and work forces including childcares.  Before school cares cannot resume at my child school because of labor shortages. What makes sps think it is ok for elementary schools to start at 930am and end at 355pm. When this happens, 1 hr or 1.5 hr after schools programs will be meaningless for most families while some kids who start at 730am and ends at 155pm will receive 3hr to3.5hr of after school program. This will lead some families to earn more money than others. Please remember not all parents can work from home. Please start elementary schools 730 and 830. Middle schools and high schools are 930.

It is already nearly impossible to get her out of the door to get her on the bus by 7:15, and she never gets enough sleep (for context, she's 8, so it's not like she's a teenager or something.) When Viewlands returns to its normal location, it would be fine for school to start at 7:30 because we can walk there in about 10 minutes - but the proposed change next year will make 4th grade unnecessarily difficult for my kid, and I imagine that would be the case for many kids at schools in temporary locations where almost everyone rides the bus. I'm hopeful the district can find another solution for temporary locations at least - I'm all for increasing bus routes, but catching the bus at 6:40 a.m. is really untennable for my family.",

Transportation has also been difficult for families, so school transportation may be necessary, but maybe the school district could think outside the box and consider using the Access (Solid Ground/ King County rides) if bus drivers are not available - or if there are smaller groups of children. Of course drivers should be trained for safety and transport of students.. One idea of probably a myriad of ideas. (And earlier school start times may work for some families- who have employment that starts at 7 or 8 am, but I wonder the percentage of families whom this is the case.)",

However, pushing back the start time at Arbor Heights to 7:30 would make bus pick-up time so early for her that she would be unable to use the bus as transportation to school. In other words, changing the start time to make bus service more accessible to more students would make the service inaccessible to her as a result of her disabilities (which include, among other things, difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, a behavioral eating disorder, and issues regulating emotions, including separation anxiety and troubles with transitions). Though it is possible that I would still be able to get her to school by transporting her myself, mitigating but not entirely compensating for the lost time in the morning, doing so would be greatly disruptive to our family and would have a negative impact on my daughter due to her disabilities. As a result, we would likely seek alternative transportation from SPS, to be paid for by SPS, such that she could access transportation to school at a time that works with her disabilities.",
    "freeForm3TierImpact": "My daughter is in Kindergarten at Arbor Heights. She has an IEP and is entitled to bus service under federal law. However, changing the school's start time to 7:30 would have such a negative and disproportionate impact on her because of her disabilities, which include (1) difficulty falling and staying asleep and (2) a behavioral eating disorder, that she would likely not be able to use the bus transportation system next year. It is already very difficult for her to get adequate sleep and nutrition in the morning while still catching the bus at the current arrival time of 7:10. Pushing pick-up time back into the 6 o'clock hour would require her to wake up during the 5 o'clock hour, virtually guaranteeing a deficit of sleep and nutrition upon arrival at school. Clearly, being tired and hungry will have a negative impact on my daughter's ability to function, behave, and learn at school. To mitigate this impact as much as possible (though not completely), I would have to find alternative transportation for her, with the \"easiest\" solution (for SPS) being for me to drive her myself. While not impossible, doing so will be very disruptive for our family as my other child's school doesn't start until 8:30 and is almost directly across the street from Arbor Heights, requiring my 8-year-old to either (1) be ready and come with us at 7:10, just to sit in the car for an hour to wait for her school to start, or (2) wake up, get dressed, make breakfast and otherwise get ready for school by herself while I'm driving back and forth to Arbor Heights.

Also, we have a 3 yr old who is in daycare and the daycare doesn't start until 8 am, so we are left with more \"tweener time\" because despite our best efforts, they rise together in the morning. For our son in B.F. day, this means even more time in after school care - we have two working parents and our work days don't change just because the school system has decided to let our kids out even earlier in the afternoon.

The changes to the bell schedule would affect both the health and well being of our families (our children are TIRED and go to bed at 6 to be able to get up at 6:45am, asking them to get up earlier would demand an earlier bedtime, which impacts free play time which is imperative to childhood development) but also our work schedules. We work from 9am to about 4, with unsupervised kid time often being at home, with less work for one parent during those hours, stretching that time would impact kids and adults. In addition to all these concerns which are shared by the majority of working parents, I am disabled. Asking me to sleep less will impact my health, and therefore the experiences of my kids. I know I am by far not the only chronically Ill parent in the district, and asking disabled parents of young children to sacrifice their rest time risks our health.",

Bus drivers will not be interested in doing a job that they are not being paid enough to do. I realize that money does not grow on trees, but do the right thing for all parties involved. Do the extra work to find a way to distribute the district’s funds in a way that will pay bus drivers enough.

There are about 10 kids that catch the bus in the morning to TC, which has had most of its bus service suspended for several years as an option school, especially during COVID. In the afternoon, only about 30 kids are using the bus. To change the start time to 7:30am, an ungodly time for kids or adults to have to be prepared for school, especially when it's DARK OUTSIDE for only 30 kids, is ridiculous. To add to the problem, releasing the kids at 1:55pm or 2pm each afternoon would cause serious childcare issues for so many families. After school childcare at TC has notoriously been impossible to access - as you must sign up within the first 5 minutes of the registration opening and now Kid's Time has announced that they are cutting their programming by 60% next fall due to staff shortages. NO parents of 7:30am start time kids will be able to work real jobs. I simply cannot understand why we can't just start at 8:30am when so few kids are accessing the very limited bus service.",

My understanding is the current program does not have capacity or enough staff to cover current needs (given worker shortage, not sure how this will be remedied). We have made the current start times work partly due to ability to work from home for one parent due to Covid. The other parent has strict shift work to cover, 9:30 start time would make before and after school care dependent on one parent versus the somewhat balanced morning coverage we currently have. I’d expect a larger impact the following year when kids would have different start times. I do see a greater concern with how to handle current work and the timing.",

How is their before/after school care handled? It seems like there is an assumption that this change will allow enough bus drivers to be hired (which still may or may not work) but doesn’t consider the current lack of before/after school care and how that is an equal issue or may impact more kids/families.",
